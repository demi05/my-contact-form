## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCSS(https://tailwindcss.com)

### What I learned

I learned how to do error handling in react for the first time. I used useState to keep track of currrent states and was able to display errors based on that

### Continued development
- I hope to be able to integrate form data to a json file to actually store form responses. I will be coming back to do this.
